&HEAD CHID='smokex320', TITLE='Verify Smokeview Smoke3D Feature' /

  A quantitative test of the smoke opacity calculation in Smokeview.  This test simplifies
  the general case by assuming a uniform distribution of smoke.  Smoke grey levels are computed
  using 

     grey level (GL) = 255*exp(-K*S*rho*DX)

  where K=8700 m2/kg is the mass extinction value and DX=0.5 m is the path length through the smoke,
  rho=1.195 kg/m3 is the ambient air density.  
  This equation is inverted to obtain

    DX = -LN(GL/255)/(K*S*rho)
    S = -LN(GL/255)/(K*DX*rho)

  For GL=110, S=1.661744 * 10**-4 kg/m3 is the soot density
