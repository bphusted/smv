&HEAD CHID='smoke_test', TITLE='Verify Smokeview Smoke3D Feature' /

  A quantitative test of the smoke opacity calculation in Smokeview.  This test simplifies
  the general case by assuming a uniform distribution of smoke.  Smoke grey levels are computed
  using 

     grey level (GL) = 255*exp(-K*S*DX)

  where K=8700 m2/kg is the mass extinction value, S=7.922 * 10**-5 kg/m3 is the soot density 
  and DX is the path length through the smoke.  This equation is inverted to obtain

    DX = -LN(GL/255)/(K*S)

  and is used to place smoke sensors at 0.5, 1, 3, 4 and 5 meters so that the predicted 
  grey levels are 181, 128, 64, 32, 16 and 8 .
