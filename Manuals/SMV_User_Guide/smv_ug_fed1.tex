\subsection{Fractional effective dose (FED) slices}
The fractional effective dose (FED), developed by Purser~\cite{SFPE:Purser},
is an estimate of human incapacitation
due to a limited set of combustion gases.
FED index data is computed by the program fds2fed using CO, $\mathrm{CO_2}$ and $\mathrm{O_2}$ gas
concentration data computed by FDS.
This data is made available to fds2fed in the form of slice files.
fds2fed computes FED data using
\be
\mathrm{FED}_\mathrm{tot}\ = \mathrm{FED}_\mathrm{CO}
\times \mathrm{HV}_\mathrm{CO_2}\ + \mathrm{FED}_\mathrm{O_2}
\ee
where $\mathrm{FED}_\mathrm{tot}$ is the total FED,
$\mathrm{FED}_\mathrm{CO}$ is the FED due to CO,
$\mathrm{HV}_\mathrm{CO_2}$ is a hyper-ventilating factor
applied to CO and $\mathrm{FED}_\mathrm{O_2}$
is the FED due to $\mathrm{O_2}$.
The species data slices used to compute an FED slice needs to be specified at the
same location.  To generate an FED slice at $y=1.6$, specify the following species slices in the input file
\begin{lstlisting}
&SLCF PBY=1.6,QUANTITY='VOLUME FRACTION' SPEC_ID='CARBON DIOXIDE' /
&SLCF PBY=1.6,QUANTITY='VOLUME FRACTION' SPEC_ID='CARBON MONOXIDE' /
&SLCF PBY=1.6,QUANTITY='VOLUME FRACTION' SPEC_ID='OXYGEN' /
\end{lstlisting}

FED computations are stored by fds2fed in slice files and an auxilliary .smv file named
casename.fedsmv for subsequent use by smokeview where casename is the name of the case.
Time step intervals
should be chosen to ensure accuracy since this computation integrates data found in slice files.  Figure \ref{figfedslice}\ illustrates
an FED slice file at several times.  The FED colorbar is split at values of 0.3, 1.0 and 3.0.  When FED slices are displayed using the FED colorbar (colorbar illustrated in Figure \ref{figfedslice}), Smokeview computes color levels assuming a minimum FED level of 0.0 and a maximum level of 3.0.  To display FED data using other data bounds, a different colorbar needs to be chosen.
