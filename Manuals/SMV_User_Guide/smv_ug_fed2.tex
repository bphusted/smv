\subsection{Isosurfaces from fractional effective dose data (generated by Smokeview)}
As with 2D slices, Smokeview computes the fractional effective dose (FED) for isosurfaces
if 3D slices for $\mathrm{CO_2}$, CO and $\mathrm{O_2}$ are
specified in the FDS input file.  3D slices are required to compute isosurfaces.
Again, these slices need to be specified at the
same location as in
\begin{lstlisting}
&SLCF XB=0.0,1.6,0.0,1.6,0.0,3.2,QUANTITY='VOLUME FRACTION' SPEC_ID='CARBON DIOXIDE' /
&SLCF XB=0.0,1.6,0.0,1.6,0.0,3.2,QUANTITY='VOLUME FRACTION' SPEC_ID='CARBON MONOXIDE' /
&SLCF XB=0.0,1.6,0.0,1.6,0.0,3.2,QUANTITY='VOLUME FRACTION' SPEC_ID='OXYGEN' /
\end{lstlisting}
Figure \ref{figfediso}\ illustrates
an FED isosurfaces where the three levels are at 0.3 (blue), 1.0 (yellow) and 3.0 (red).

{FED isosurfaces.
These level surfaces were generated using CO, CO2 and O2 3D data slices.
The blue, yellow and red surfaces represent where the
fed values are 0.3, 1.0 and 3.0 respectively.
